# HandyVandy
HandyVandy is a platform to provide additional career opportunities and accelerate financial prospects. We primarily offer services to students who are attending Vanderbilt University. By employing location-based services to identify local 
assistance, this application facilitates students' engagement with other individuals on campus for a variety of tasks like relocation, food preparation, delivery, selling unwanted goods, and auctioning. 
We are going to use client and server architecture. In addition, we will use React as the frontend framework and Node.js as the backend framework. We also use Firebase for both the database and the user authentication.
